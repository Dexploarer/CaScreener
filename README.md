# Tickergeist 👻

Tickergeist is an **Alpha Terminal** for the Solana trenches. What started as an experiment in **User-Generated Interfaces (UGI)** has evolved into a toolkit for degens who want deeper insights and cleaner visuals.

This project is a gift back to the trenches. It's free, it's open-source, and it's built for those who live on the edge of the next big narrative.

## ⚡ Core Philosophy
> "Giving back to the trenches is paramount." 

Tickergeist is designed to be forked, hacked, and extended. It focuses on high-fidelity visual intelligence—turning raw on-chain data into shareable, actionable "SpecStream" dashboards.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **SpecStream Engine**: Real-time generation of interactive UIs via `json-render`. No static dashboards—only what you need, when you need it.
- **Helius Wallet Intel**: Deep-dive analytics for any Solana address. Enhanced transactions, asset tracking, and custom-generated dashboards.
- **Exhaustive Terminal (Super Dashboard)**: Trigger keywords like `super` or `exhaustive` to pull real-time CoinGecko metadata (socials, repos) and project health metrics (Community/Developer scores).
- **Convex Meta-Memory**: A persistent RAG layer that tracks narratives, ticker collisions, and risk signals across the SOL ecosystem.
- **Viral Toolkit**: 
  - **DegenGauge**: Visual risk scoring.
  - **WhaleRadar**: Real-time activity tracking.
  - **OG Image Factory**: Dynamic image generation for social sharing.
  - **Remotion Videos**: Deterministic marketing clips generated from live pump.fun snapshots.

## 🔮 The Roadmap (If You Want It)
This is just the beginning. If the trenches find this useful, we have more built-out logic ready to push:
- **Direct Launching**: Launch tokens on pump.fun directly from the Tickergeist UI.
- **Pump Meta Scan**: In-AI analytics to scan narratives before you enter.
- **Hype Automation**: Automated banners, marketing graphics, and full-suite AI analytics.

## 🛠️ Quick Start

```bash
bun install
bun dev
```

1. Create a `.env.local` based on `.env.example`.
2. Set your `OPENAI_API_KEY` (or Anthropic) for the AI SDK.
3. Configure `HELIUS_API_KEY` for on-chain wallet intelligence.
4. (Optional) Set up **Convex** for the RAG narrative memory.
